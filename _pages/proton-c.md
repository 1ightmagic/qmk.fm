More info on this to come soon! Here's our annoucement:

> /u/ishtob, /u/skullydazed, and I have been working a USB-C ARM Pro Micro drop-in replacement that we've decided to call the **QMK Proton C**. It uses an STM32F303 chip (same chip as the rev 6 Planck and Skully's new ARM boards), and has some more pin-outs and extended functionality on a break-off-able tab. [Here's a render to get the idea of what we're talking about](https://i.imgur.com/ce3wXGj.png).
> 
> The extended tab also has a slot cut in it for an SMD speaker that will be flush with the PCB - the same speaker that I've use on my boards. The pin alignment uses the same spacing as the main side, skipping one for the cutting/breakable area.
> 
> This should work on any board that currently accepts a Pro Micro, as all of the pin-outs are in the same locations, including 5V, 3.3V, GND, SPI, Serial, and I2C. The reset pin works slightly different, but will have a reset button on the front. 
> 
> We’re planning on stocking this on olkb.com and clueboard.co, but if you’d like to see this on your shop as well, please reach out to me or Skully!
