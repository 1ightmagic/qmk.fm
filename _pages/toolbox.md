## QMK Toolbox - [View on Github](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox)

This is a collection of useful tools packaged into one app. This is a pretty recent developement, but is looking to replace the QMK Flasher.

Currently it can:

 * Flash .hex files to DFU-compatible bootloaders
 * Listen to HID console messages from QMK boards
