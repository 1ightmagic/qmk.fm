## QMK Toolbox - [View on Github](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox)

This is a collection of useful tools packaged into one app. This is a pretty recent developement, but is looking to replace the QMK Flasher.

Currently it can:

 * Flash .hex, .bin, .qmk files to:
    * DFU (Atmel/Lufa) bootloaders
    * Halfkay (Teensy) bootloaders
    * Caterina (Arduino) bootloaders
    * STM32 (ARM) bootloaders
 * Listen to HID console messages from QMK boards
