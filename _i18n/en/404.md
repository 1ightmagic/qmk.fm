Sorry, that link may have been moved - please email jack@qmk.fm with the link/content you're looking for, and I'll do my best to restore it! It also may not be translated yet - check out the English version here: <a id="en-url"></span>

<script>
var url = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname.replace(/\/[^/]+/, '');
var a = document.getElementById("en-url")
a.innerHTML = url;
a.href = url;
