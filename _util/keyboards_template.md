## All Supported Keyboards

This page is automatically generated from keyboards currently in QMK.

Default .hex files are up-to-date with the latest version of QMK, and get pushed every build via Travis. Each uses the `default` keymap, but alternative ones are stored here as well - substitute `default` for `<keymap>` in the url to access them. All links take the format `<keyboard>_<keymap>.hex` or `<keyboard>_<subproject>_<keymap>.hex`.

Want a qmk.fm page? [Create a `<keyboard>.md` file for it here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk.fm/tree/gh-pages/_pages/keyboards)! (use others as examples/templates)

Currently only .hex files are provided - some listed here may not be what's needed flash the keyboard. If this is the case, [please open an issue](https://github.com/qmk/qmk.fm/issues)!
