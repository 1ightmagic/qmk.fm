<title>Hello Strapdown</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">
# Twey's Home Configuration
## Layers
- Layer 0: Non-ANSI Dvorak layout, with modified modifiers — all
  modifiers on thumb keys, as well as return and space.
- Layer 1: Default symbol layout.
- Layer 2: Plover-oriented stenography layer.
- Layer 3: Extended media/mouse layout.

## Unusual features
The Plover key (top right key on the left half) also sends my Plover
‘toggle’ chord (SH-FT) when pressed, as well as toggling the steno
layer, so you can toggle between steno and typing modes with a single
keypress.

If you want to use this feature, you'll need to add the
`commands.json` dictionary to your Plover dictionaries, or define the
toggle stroke (`PHROLG`) yourself.
