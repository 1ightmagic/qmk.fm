<h1 id="german-layout-for-the-ergodox">German Layout for the ErgoDox</h1>
<p>This layout is inspired by the &quot;kinesis-qwerty-mod&quot; from benblazak's<br />
<a href="https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware">ergodox-firmware</a>, as well as by the &quot;german&quot; layout from the<br />
<a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware">qmk_firmware</a>.<br />
The goal was to have a layout that is pretty close to an ordinary German<br />
keyboard, so I don't have to make adjustments on the operating system level<br />
and I keep some of the muscle memory to use a regular keyboard.</p>
<p>Modifications I made with regard to the aforementioned layouts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The key layout is pretty close to the layout of a German Kinesis Ergo Elan.<br />
The only exception I made is that I reversed the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; cursor keys,<br />
since that feels more natural to me.</p></li>
<li><p>All layer changes are &quot;momentary&quot;, i.e. they only last as long as the respective key is pressed.</p></li>
<li><p>I sacrificed the Hyper and Meh keys, which I don't use, and put layer change keys in their place.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a PrintScreen key which I use quite regularly for screenshots.</p></li>
</ul>
