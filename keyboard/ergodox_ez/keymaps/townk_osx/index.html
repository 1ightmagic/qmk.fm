<h1 id="townks-keymap">Townk's Keymap</h1>
<p>Trying to take care of an enjury on my arm I borrow an ergonomic keyboard from<br />
a frient (<a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-pro-for-pc-mac/">Kinesis Advantage</a>).</p>
<p>I really enjoyed my time with it but there were some anoyancies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The curvature on the keys bothered me since I'm a Vim user and using the<br />
motion keys on my editor was awkard.</li>
<li>I had to spend too much time remapping the keyboard to make some symbol keys<br />
more accessible to me.</li>
<li>The fact that my hands had to stay close to each other was a bit stressfull<br />
to my sholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>After a long research I find out that Ergodox EZ would be perfect for my needs<br />
and purchase one. Before the keyboard even got in my hands I started to think<br />
on the layout I would use on it and soon enough I planed couple adjustments<br />
from the Kinesis I was using so far.</p>
<h2 id="the-layout">The layout</h2>
<p>Here are the layout mapping in images so you can have a glimpse on it:</p>
<p><img src="townk_osx_base.png" alt="Base Layout" /><br />
<img src="townk_osx_fn.png" alt="fn Layout" /><br />
<img src="townk_osx_keypad.png" alt="Keypad &amp; Mouse Layout" /></p>
<p>Notice that, differently from the default behavior, my layer keys are not transparent<br />
by default, which means that if you press any non-labeled white key, nothing will be<br />
handled to the OS.</p>
<h3 id="one-shot-keys">One shot keys</h3>
<p>It all started with the access to the function keys (F1, F2, F3...), since<br />
those keys are located on a different layer I needed a way to press them with<br />
minimal effort without disrupting my flow.</p>
<p>For me, togglihg a layer to press a button and than toggle it back is a waste<br />
of time (although I admit it's a single tap from what I have), so I decided to<br />
do it as a one shot key. I could press it and the next pressed key would be<br />
handled by the target layer which just after it delivers the key to the OS it<br />
would get back to the previous layer.</p>
<p>After setting up my layout to do just that I realized that occasionally I<br />
would stop myseld on the middle of the process and the one shot layer would be<br />
still triggered until I press any other key. So to prevent me from tapping<br />
keys I don't want I added a timeout of 3 seconds for the one shot actions.</p>
<p>Ultimately I tested the shift key as a one shot one and really like it, so<br />
here you have it, all the one shot keys on my layout.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the Mac symbols used on some keys, here is a<br />
reference to them:</p>
