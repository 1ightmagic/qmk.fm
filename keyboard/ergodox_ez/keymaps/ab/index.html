<h1 id="beginners-keymap-for-ergodox-ez">Beginner's keymap for Ergodox-EZ</h1>
<p>Beginner's keymap emulates standard QWERTY keyboard for beginners. Once you get comfortable with the Ergodox-EZ, you may fork this keymap and customize it for your own needs or find a suitable one from the community contributed keymaps.</p>
<p><img src="keyboard-layout.png" alt="Beginner&#39;s Keymap" /></p>
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easier to switch between regular keyboards and Ergodox-EZ.</li>
<li>Easy on beginners. It has everything you need for your day to day usage.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keys are not ergonomically placed to take full advantage of Ergodox-EZ. Take a look at this <a href="https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboard/ergodox_ez/keymaps/default/readme.md">Default Keymap</a></li>
<li>While multiple layers are possible, beginner's keymap only uses one additional layer for mouse, function and volume keys.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notes">Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ideally number key [6] should have started from the right-hand side of the keyboard. Doing so breaks the familiar QWERTY layout.</li>
<li>Quote key ['] should have been placed between [:] and [Enter]. Due to lack of key space, it is placed below [Enter].</li>
<li>Double [Alt] keys are placed adjacent to each other for convenience.</li>
<li>[CapsLock] also acts as [Ctrl] key when you press and hold. It is convenient for GNU Emacs users.</li>
<li>Additional bracket keys are placed in the center of the keyboard for programmer's convenience.</li>
</ul>
