# ErgoDox EZ Utilities

The Python script in this directory, by [mbarkhau](https://github.com/mbarkhau) allows you to write out a basic ErgoDox EZ keymap using Markdown notation, and then transpile it to C, which you can then compile. It's experimental, but if you're not comfortable using C, it's a nice option.
