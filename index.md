## Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](http://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](http://www.ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](http://clueboard.co/).

## Included Keyboards

* [Planck](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/planck/)
* [Preonic](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/preonic/)
* [ErgoDox EZ](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/ergodox/)
* [Clueboard](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/clueboard/)
* [Cluepad](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/cluepad/)

The project also includes community support for [lots of other keyboards](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/).

## Maintainers

QMK is developed and maintained by Jack Humbert of OLKB with contributions from the community, and of course, [Hasu](https://github.com/tmk). This repo used to be a fork of [TMK](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard), and we are incredibly grateful for his founding contributions to the firmware. We've had to break the fork due to purely technical reasons - it simply became too different over time, and we've had to start refactoring some of the basic bits and pieces. We are huge fans of TMK and Hasu :\)

The OLKB product firmwares are maintained by [Jack Humbert](https://github.com/jackhumbert), the Ergodox EZ by [Erez Zukerman](https://github.com/ezuk), and the Clueboard by [Zach White](https://github.com/skullydazed).
