            <p>This keymap is my preferred layout (after a certain amount of experimentation).<br />The rationale behind the design is as follows:</p>
<p>I grew up typing from a very early age and thus never learned the &quot;correct&quot; way<br />to touch type (essentially, I'm self-taught). As a, result my fingers don't<br />tend to stay on the &quot;home keys&quot; and occasionally my right hand wants to type<br />keys that are on the left of the keyboard, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Hence, despite liking the idea of split keyboards in principle, I've never been<br />able to get on with them because the split simply doesn't work with my style of<br />typing. The Ergodox solves this neatly by virtue of having a few extra keys in<br />the &quot;middle&quot; of the keyboard which I can utilise for deliberate redundancy.<br />Thus in this keymap there are two &quot;6&quot; keys (one on the left, one on the right)<br />and likewise Y, H, G, and B are all duplicated to enable one-handed patterns<br />that I use frequently (e.g. &quot;byobu&quot; with the right hand, &quot;yes&quot; with the left,<br />etc.).</p>
<p>I occasionally use the numeric pad for data entry, thus this is duplicated<br />under the natural home position of the right hand in layer 1 (activated by<br />holding one of the right thumb buttons), while the cursor keys are duplicated<br />under the classic WASD gaming layout of the left hand in layer 2 (activated by<br />holding one of the left thumb buttons). Various other useful keys also appear<br />in these layers (brackets and symbols for coding in layer 1, navigation and<br />F-keys in layer 2, etc.).</p>
<p>Finally, modifier keys like Ctrl, Shift, and Alt, along with Backspace and<br />Enter are all in traditional locations in an effort to reuse existing muscle<br />memory as much as possible (keys like =, #, and ' are in layer 1). The layout<br />maps are in the comments of keymap_dave.c so I won't bother duplicating them<br />here.</p>
<p>Oh, and the LEDs are rather pimped ... because I could!</p>
<p>Anyway, although I'm sure this keymap won't be to many people's taste you might<br />find some interesting ideas in here for your own layouts. Do tweet me</p>
<p>(@waveform80) if you have any questions / suggestions / bugs.</p>
