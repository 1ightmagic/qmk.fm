# Falsehoods People Believe About Keyboards

## There is an endgame

Sooner or later there will be another board you lust after.

## PBT > ABS

It depends on what your preferences and goals are. Thick high quality ABS is better than thin PBT. Some people prefer caps that are shiny and smooth. ABS allows for light bleed through certain colors. 

Doubleshot PBT is very hard to get consistently correct. Most PBT is dyesub, which limits you to legends that are darker than the cap.

## Keyboards are either Ortholinear or Staggered

There are at least 3 different ways to arrange the keys that are commonly seen, and others that people have experimented with.

**Staggered**- What you see on the vast majority of keyboards. Each row of keys is offset to the right by 0.25 or 0.5 key widths.

**Ortholinear**- Popularized by Jack Humbert with the Planck (and other OLKB boards) this arrangement sees the keys in a horizontal/vertical grid pattern where each key is an exact multiple of 1U (no fractional sizes like 1.25). 

**Columnar Staggered**- Seen on boards like the Ergodox, in this arrangement each column is staggered by 0.1 to 0.25 key heights. The typical pattern is to form an arc that roughly follows the finger lengths of the designer.

**Ortho Staggered**- Seen on the Zlant, this layout uses a 5x12 grid layout that has each row offset by 0.25u to the right.

**Mirrored Staggered**- First seen on the Katana60, this layout staggers the left hand and the right hand in opposite directions.

## There are objectively better choices

Keyboards are highly subjective. Not everyone shares the same goals, and what your goals are will heavily influence what you choose.

## Keyboards need a PCB

A lot of people who want to experiment with new layouts hand-wire to something like a teensy or promicro.

## Keyboards need a Plate

If you have a PCB and a good way to mount it, you donâ€™t actually need a plate. PCB mount switches have fixing pins so that they have a solid mechanical connection to the PCB.

## Heavy keyboards are better

It depends on what you do with it. Do you want carry a heavy keyboard around in a backpack? Use it on the couch?
